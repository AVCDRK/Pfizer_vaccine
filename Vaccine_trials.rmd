## Create a table from the published data


```{r}
groupsize = 44000
subgp = groupsize/2
vaccine = c(subgp-9,9)
placebo =  c(subgp-85,85)
results = as.table(cbind(vaccine,placebo))
rownames(results) <- c("none","covid")

```

## Look at a "percentage barchart" of the reported cases.  If the vaccine is innefective then covid should be more or less equally distributed between the vaccine and the placebo.  The more effective the vaccine the lower would be the percent in the group of covid.

```{r}
barchartGC(results,type = "percent")
```

```{r}
fisher.test(results)
```
